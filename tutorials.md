## TensorFlow.js中的核心概念

了解TensorFlow.js中的核心概念例如张量,运算符,模型,层和训练.还要学习一些关于内存管理和编写整洁代码的技巧.

## 训练第一步：拟合曲线到合成数据

This tutorial demonstrates building a small toy model completely from scratch using TensorFlow.js operations. We will fit a curve to some synthetic data that we generate using a polynomial function.

Training on images — Recognizing Handwritten Digits with a Convolutional Neural Network
This tutorial shows how to build a convolutional neural network to recognize handwritten digits in images (MNIST). We will use the TensorFlow.js layers API to construct, train, and evaluate the model.

Transfer learning - Train a neural network to predict from webcam data
This tutorial explains how to train a neural network to make predictions from webcam data. We'll use those predictions to play Pac-Man!

How to import a Keras Model into TensorFlow.js
This tutorial explains how to convert and serve an existing Keras model to run in the browser.

Saving and Loading tf.Model
This tutorial explains how to save tf.Models to various destinations such as the web browser's Local Storage and load them back.

How to import a TensorFlow SavedModel into TensorFlow.js
This tutorial explains how to convert and serve an existing TensorFlow SavedModel to run in the browser.

How to define a custom WebGL operation
This tutorial explains how to create a custom WebGL operation that can be used alongside other Tensorflow.js operations.
